	<h2>Welcome to MemoFarma!</h2>
	
		<div>This document will help you to learn how to use the program 
			(touch the icons or move the page to right or left to change the context):</div>
		
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Start by entering the drugs list you take during the day 
				from <img src="terapia.png"> <b>"Therapy"</b>;</li>
			<br>
			<li>MemoFarma will remind you to take a drug activating the alarm. 
				The ringtone will continue until you confirm this on the outcome of administration. 
				You can indicate whether the therapy was administered or not choosing between "Taken" or "Will not take" or decide to postpone choosing "Repeat";</li>
			<br>
			<li>In the Agenda the cell of today will be coloured green if 
				all the administrations are recorded as "taken" or 
				red if one have been recorded as "will not take". The day 
				won't have a colour if you don't have recorded your 
				administration.
			</li>
		</ol> 

		<br>

		<div>Now we discuss the details of the following areas.</div>
		 
		 <table  cellpadding="5">
		 	<tr><td bgcolor="#dddddd">
				 <img src="calendario.png"> <b>Agenda</b><br>
			</td></tr>	 
			<tr><td>
				In the Agenda you can check if you are following your therapy regularly 
				by the days' colour. It will be green or red in case of right or wrong 
				admistration of the therapy. It will be no coloured if you didn't 
				indicate your administration or if the date of the day is previous 
				the recording of the medicines'list. 
				<br><br>
				You should see in a detailed way the evolution of the day touching every 
				single day of a month, or the one of the month touching its name. 
				<br><br>	
				From the application's menu you can create a spreadsheet or a document 
				with the evolution of the month you can send by email.
				<br><br>
				To change month you can use the buttons on each side of the current's month 
				name or move the page up or down.
